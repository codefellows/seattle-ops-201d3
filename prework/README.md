# Prework - Ops 201: Foundations of Computer Operations

This is the mandatory pre-work for Ops 201. When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to our online class portal, called Canvas, where you can confirm that you've completed this pre-work and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it.

> **Note: All pre-work is due before start of first class**

## Ops Lab Kit

If you are testing in, and don't yet have an Ops Lab Kit, ensure you get one delivered in time for the start of class. 

- Obtain and unbox your lab kit. 
- Ensure all items are present. 
- Test computer, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. 
- If you haven't isntalled an operating system yet, the computer should display a short startup sequence that will result in a boot failure error. This is expected. We will take care of that as a part of class.
